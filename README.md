# Hi, I'm Valentin 👋

**Senior Software Engineer** specializing in Developer Experience, CI/CD, and platform engineering.

I build tools and infrastructure that help developers ship faster. Currently exploring how to make webhook testing less painful.

## 🚀 Currently Building

**[Hookie](https://hookie.sh)** - Open-source webhook development tool  
Multi-developer webhook testing using Go, Next.js, Redis Streams, and gRPC. Solving the problem of local webhook testing for distributed teams.

**[Personal Site](https://valentinprugnaud.dev)** - Blog and portfolio  
Writing about developer experience, platform engineering, and building tools.

## 💼 What I Do

I spent the last 6 years at TELUS building developer experience infrastructure:

- Migrated organization from Jenkins to GitHub Actions (96% deployment time reduction)
- Built internal deployment platform replicating Vercel's UX on Google Cloud Run
- Established testing infrastructure, config management, and platform standards

Before that: startups, agencies, and founding Speakbox (mental health platform, 2019-2024).
